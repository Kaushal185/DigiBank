# DIGIBANK
DIGIBANK, an Angular-based banking application, offers a streamlined digital banking experience. Users can securely log in, accessing a comprehensive account summary displaying details such as account numbers, types, and available balances. The application maintains a detailed transaction history, allowing users to review past debit and credit activities. DIGIBANK empowers users to initiate fund transfers seamlessly, ensuring accurate and prompt updates to account balances.
Utilizing a JSON server for data simulation, DIGIBANK facilitates testing and development without the need for a full backend infrastructure. The Angular framework powers the frontend, providing an intuitive user interface and handling user interactions effectively. To run the application, users can clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the Angular application alongside the JSON server.
As part of future enhancements, DIGIBANK aims to implement additional security measures like two-factor authentication, offer customizable user profiles, and eventually integrate a real backend for production deployment. DIGIBANK embodies simplicity, security, and functionality, catering to users seeking a modern and efficient digital banking solution.
